262,0,"""Overall experience is ok. My mix: refrigerated suprep, slightly chilled water, ginger ale. Drink as fast as you can.  After gulping down as much as you can simply suck on a lemon to get rid of the taste.  Continue process and it&#039;ll be over quickly.  The second bottle in the morning is tougher.  Might be because your stomach is not expanded and chugging the solution plus two more 16oz bottles of water is really filling.  It started working for me 20min after drinking.  Be sure to get wet wipes.  BTW there&#039;s no pain with the bathroom part of it, not like an upset stomach, it takes surprisingly little effort for the bowel movement.  Good luck"""
274,1,"""I had a severe allergic reaction to this medication. Hives on the trunk of my body. The palms of my hands and the soles of my feet had severe itching.  The itching was also in my throat and ears."""
359,1,"""I originally took this for three months a year ago.  It worked great during the time with minimal side effects.  Went off of it with no problem and had no heartburn for quite a long time.  When I had an acid reflux episode last fall, I took it for about a week, where all these weird side effects happened.  Developed lower right back pain, joints kept cracking when moving, and the occasional stomach pain in the lower left abdomen.  Am disappointed since it was the only thing that really helped my reflux."""
382,1,"""I&#039;ve been taking Nexium for about 18 years now. I suffered bad heartburn/reflux etc,, that was partly to do with &#039;trigger&#039; foods I ate. Over the years I learned to avoid those foods, &amp; I started on Nexium. This medicine reduced my severe heartburn/reflux from maybe each second night when I wasn&#039;t taking it, to only about 2 times a month when I was taking it, so overall, over 18 years, Nexium made a huge difference to my life. From having to sit upright till 4am in bed till the pain went away &amp; I could finally lie down (without Nexium) to getting a good sleep most nights (with Nexium).
I do thoroughly recommend Nexium to anyone who can take it. Tip - AVOID Trigger foods! some are - chocolate, cream, oily foods, chickpeas, horseradish, mustard."""
451,0,"""I&#039;ve only been taking this medication for about 2 weeks and notice a severe drop off in my anxiety levels around people.

502,0,"""I was on it a total of 4 weeks-actually 3 1/2. The first week went well- no issues or concerns. By the 2nd week I started noticing my dreams and frequency of them. I was able to give up a lot of my smoking. Didn&#039;t really feel like I wanted to smoke either. By the 3rd week. I was going through a bad rash, hellish nightmares, violent nightmares, somewhat suicidal dreams, stomach flu like symptoms, nasty irritability,  I was in full blown &quot;side effects hell&quot; I called my Dr and asked what to do- she immediately pulled me off of them. I still personally feel that the way it affects your brain and the known side effects that people on it should consult with a Psycologist during the process."""

1492,0,"""I was prescribed Cymbalta for a combination of chronic pain from osteoarthritis and major depressive disorder with melancholia. I started with 30mg for the first two weeks, but had to stop taking my daily 1200 to 1800mg of ibuprofen and also quit drinking. For depression, it was amazing. I felt relief from my despondency within a handful of days, and that has continued through this, my third month. I had my dose increased to 60mg to try and get relief from the chronic pain, but it has not been effective for me in addressing that - thus my rating. For depression, I give it a 10, but for pain (my experience) I have to give it at best, a 3. After consulting with my doctor, he said I could resume taking ibuprofen at a much lower dose."""
1744,0,"""My blood pressure was high (144/90 -180/110) My doctors tried Alpha and Beta Blockers, Calcium Channel Blockers, Ace Inhibitors, Angiotension II 
Receptor Blockers, and diuretics. My best pressure was 138/90.  The first week we tried Benicar HCT 40/25, I could tell a big difference. My best pressure was 128/78.  After losing some weight, pressure dropped as well.  116/68. I started feeling extremely dizzy. Broke the pill in half and dizziness improved. Doctor will need to adjust dosage and hopefully will be able to discontinue use by end of year if weight loss continues.  My appointments are now 3 months instead of monthly.  Overall, I am pleased with my progress since I started taking Benicar."""
1898,1,"""I took this drug for several weeks and my GERD cleared up.  Then, out of the blue, I became moody and angry at everyone.  I read up on some of the side effects and found that mood issues have been associated.  I tend to have this when I take anything that amps up your metabolism so it must contain something that is somewhat related to that."""

2353,0,"""I wanted to try this because pills just were not working for me and I decided a non-hormonal IUD would be my best bet. Insertion was pretty painful and I had to rest for around 15 minutes before I could actually stand up and walk. I have had it for 3 months now and I am a person that will try something for as long as possible before I have had enough. Lower back pain, painful cramps, period that lasts 2 weeks where I bleed through super tampons in two hours, and spotting for the other 2 weeks. Crouching down for longer then 30 seconds as well as sitting on hard chairs means having painful cramps for the day. For this much pain, not worth it. Does prevent pregnancy though."""

2478,0,"""To the gentleman whose doctor switched him from Klonopin to Cymbalta:  The reason you are suffering from severe anxiety is that you were taken off a Benzodiazepine too quickly instead of having been TAPERED off the drug.  Cymbalta is no substitute for Klonopin. Your doctor needs to go back to med school!  I&#039;ve been taking 60 mg of Cymbalta since 2009, after my husband committed suicide. It has helped me a lot with depression and anxiety, but I&#039;m finding that my anxiety has recently increased because my new husband has lung cancer. I was put on 90 mg of Cymbalta recently, and I&#039;m hoping that the higher dose will decrease, and not increase, my anxiety levels."""

I will just go back to taking  my generic Famotidine  everyday. It works and works right away. I don&#039;t even care at this point that Famotidine  doesn&#039;t  heal, it just mask the symptoms.

And I am getting 4 beautiful toenails growing in! Amazing! Never been so happy to wear flip flops!
The bad: I almost stopped taking Lamisil as the first few days I felt very agitated. It went away after a week and now I am fine. I did develop a rash on my arms which I am not sure is a result of the Lamisil treatment or simply a coincidence.  But honestly it does work."""

When that was tapered off, I switched to concentrated EPA Omega-3 oil, which has controlled the panic for 18 years. But, it sometimes breaks through, especially when I am building up antibodies to an infection. That is when Tofranil (lorazepam) comes to my rescue. A 0.5 mg dose will quell the aura/breakthrough symptoms. A similar dose at bedtime will get me the crucial night of sound sleep that I need to get the disorder back into its cage.

Otezla is the least harmful when it comes to side effects.  It does not require routine lab/blood work.  You&#039;re also not really supposed to drink alcohol when taking methotrexate.  I love that Otezla does not lower you immune system and the ability to fight off infections.

The Doc put me on Protonix and after about 1 week it&#039;s as if my life was back to normal.  Unfortunately, my insurance doesn&#039;t cover it any more so I gave it a &quot;9&quot; instead of a &quot;10&quot; rating for this alone.  With many generic others costing only $5 for 60 days.

Anyway, I suggest that if you do try it, give it a few days to work."""

I am sacred  that I am dying, the Dr&#039;s tell me I&#039;m not but my intuition and my body are telling me different. I have been suffering from acid reflux for a few yrs now not knowing it because I don&#039;t have acid coming back up or gas or any other usual symptoms. The symptoms for me is my breathing is getting increasingly more difficult and wheezing non stop and persistant coughing with constant chest infections because my lungs are drowning in fluid. This is how I was told I have Gerd .. Dr put me on Dexilant 60mg daily, have been on now for 7 days feel nothing .. no change what so ever except extreme shoulders and upper back pain cannot raise my arms to put a shirt on without it bringing tears. I&#039;m 53 yrs young."""

52785,1,"""Dexilant caused diarrhea / IBS / Dairy allergy- I was prescribed it for severe heartburn /hiatus hernia/ stomach inflam. and it helped a lot.  I stopped taking dexilant 10 months ago due to severe diarrhea, cramps,nausea, bile, waking in middle of night with cramps and 1/2 hour painfull diarrhea / constipation combo /awfull cramps, gas- what I&#039;ve read on this thread I&#039;m not alone. I hate to tell those who  recently started this that  have had these issues with dexilant and  10 months off this poison and I&#039;m still suffering. I now have a dairy allergy, only after removing dairy from my diet are my severe symptoms relieved. I eat any dairy and I&#039;m sick again for 2-3 days. Existing IBS is worse than before, now a daily struggle. """
52949,0,"""I started contrave in December 2015 and lost 42 pounds (200 - 158).  The first 3-4 weeks I experienced intense neasea and headaches, but they were gone after a while.  I lost 14 pounds in the first month - I used the LoseIt app on my phone and tracked my calories, but it was pretty easy to not eat much because of the nausea.  Apples - I ate a lot of them.  It helped me when I had nausea.  
I&#039;ve gone from a size 18 to a 12 and I look and feel so much better. I haven&#039;t started exercising, but I will do that while continuing to use the LoseIt app - hoping that my tummy will tone up some while I aim to lose 8 more pounds.  

For the past 3 months, I have kept my weight steady and am ready to come off the medicine and see what it does."""
