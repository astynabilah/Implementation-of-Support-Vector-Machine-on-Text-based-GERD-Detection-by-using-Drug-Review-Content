Finally, I had DNA testing to see what I would respond to and the result was Pristiq.  I started it several months ago in a small dose (I split the pills even though they say don&#039;t do this) and within a few days my anxiety literally went away.  I was able to cut my Klonopin in 1/2 over a two month period.  The first week or two I was extremely tired but that passed.  The only side effect I get from time to time is migraines.

I&#039;m not a big fan of opiates for pain relief and would not have taken them had it not been my only choice to feel normal. (I couldnt even sit in my car for more than 15 mins without searing nerve pain).I accidently stumbled on a review that said Wellbutrin also helped with back pain.

I started this medication when I was 21 and was so desperate to find something that would actually help my on-going migraines. Personally, the side effect symptoms FAR outweighed the benefits. I started out on 25mg a day and gradually increased to 100mg. As soon as I got on this, the side effects came rolling in. Before I knew it my memory was completely gone. In daily conversation I couldn&#039;t think of simple words, names or phrases. I knew what I wanted to say but couldn&#039;t form the words to do so. The worst of all, it really affected my grades in college. I used to have awesome memorization skills. Unfortunately I would study for hours upon hours, and still wouldn&#039;t do well as I would have &quot;brain fog&quot; during tests, etc. Another side effect I experienced was weight loss. I lost around 25 lbs., HOWEVER I don&#039;t believe all of this was ultimately from topamax. I&#039;d definitely say it suppressed my appetite, but I really changed my eating habits and worked out daily. It helped with my first few pounds and got me motivated to do the rest. On the plus side, I saw a significant difference in the amount of migraines I received. It was a night and day difference in that aspect. However, approaching a year and a half on this medication I couldn&#039;t take it anymore and had to get off. It wasn&#039;t worth it anymore. I don&#039;t think tapering off or stopping cold turkey on this really makes a difference. My mom stopped cold turkey and I tapered off, as my doctor instructed me. I rebounded off this HORRIBLY, as did my mom. I was STARVING constantly after no longer taking it. This didn&#039;t just go away either. My body didn&#039;t feel levelled out and &quot;detoxed&quot; of this for honestly about a year after. I not only gained back all my weight I lost, but plus some. Although everyone&#039;s body reacts differently, I highly do NOT recommend taking this. Not even for those desperate for weight loss. Losing weight from a medication like this is not sustainable long term. I&#039;m 24 now and am still affected by my choice of taking this. Topamax has ultimately ruined my memory to this day.

I am taking very little Norco now for breakthrough pain. I am less groggy and have better concentration. It did take about a week to get used to the new medicine. All I wanted to do was sleep for that week. Now the only issue is the constipation which is brutal. Although some Senna and Miralax work well. 

I am actually thrilled with how much better I feel. It is like suddenly waking up and being alive to participate in life again. WOW"""

I usually don&#039;t know stomach acid is being sent from my stomach upperward, due to my also having a hyial hernia. Where the hyial hernia is located is always where the pain starts and remains the worst. &quot;The pain that is becoming much worse with each and every attack.

CONS:

-Period went from 3 days, to 5 - 6 days...EXTREMELY HEAVY for a few months, which subsided...however long periods, usually a few days of irregular bleeding persisted.
-Bacterial Vaginosis (never had before or after IUD, plenty of stats show copper iud users are much more likely to develop this due to the increased flora)
